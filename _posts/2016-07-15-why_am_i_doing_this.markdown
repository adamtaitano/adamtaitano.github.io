The easy answer is because I would, like to, eventually, be employable. The longer answer is: if I do become employed, I want to do something I might enjoy, as well as find challenging.

Eventually, I will enter the workplace. But first, I want to feel like I have a certain amount of competence that will allow learning-on-the-go as a junior developer to be not-so-painful. Also, I don't want to look clueless.

I also like staring at code, tinkering around with tests until something works.

I will update this as I go.

But now it's time to get back to coding and learning !
